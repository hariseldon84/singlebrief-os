# SingleBrief - Brief-first Project OS

**Confidence to Act: Transform Planning Paralysis into Execution**

SingleBrief is a Brief-first Project Operating System that eliminates the planning inertia managers face when starting new projects. Instead of creating 100 tasks manually, managers create **one brief** - and the system handles the rest.

---

## The Problem

Managers struggle to start new projects due to:

- **Overwhelming Scope**: Translating vision â†’ concrete steps feels massive
- **Time Scarcity**: Detailed planning takes too long
- **Fear of Incompleteness**: "What am I missing?"
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Lack expertise in certain areas
- **Motivation Deficit**: "Why should we do this?" and "Is this worth my time?"

Traditional project management tools force managers to create detailed task lists upfront, which creates **decision paralysis**.

---

## The Solution

SingleBrief flips the model: **One Brief â†’ AI-Powered Breakdown â†’ Confident Execution**

### Core Value Proposition

**We sell confidence, not task management.**

Confidence comes through:
1. **Visibility into Progress** (primary driver)
2. **Tracking & Roll-up** (brief + project levels)
3. **AI-Powered Breakdown** (intelligent task generation)
4. **Delegation** (AI agents + human team members)
5. **Manager Control** (accept/reject/re-run review loop)
6. **Business Value Clarity** ("Why This Matters" framing)

---

## How It Works

### The 6-Step Confidence Loop

1. **Manager creates brief** (simple text input)
2. **AI breaks down into micro-tasks** (automated decomposition)
3. **Manager reviews and edits tasks** (full control)
4. **Assign to AI agents or humans** (one assignee per task)
5. **Execute + Review cycle** (accept/reject/re-run with feedback)
6. **Track progress** (visibility at brief and project levels)

### "Why This Matters" Feature

After task breakdown, AI generates a business value section including:
- Impact articulation
- Suggested success metrics
- Motivation framing for manager and team

Managers can edit, regenerate, or skip this optional feature.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Brownfield MVP Development

The project has:
- âœ… Foundation code (React + TypeScript + Supabase)
- âœ… Basic authentication scaffolding
- âœ… Database schema (briefs, tasks, projects, team_members)
- âœ… Comprehensive PRD and brainstorming documentation
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress:** Core confidence loop implementation

**Timeline:**
- Weeks 1-4: Core MVP (confidence loop, AI agents, review system)
- Week 5: "Why This Matters" feature + polish
- Week 5+: Invite-only beta launch

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Traditional Project Management (Asana, Monday, ClickUp)
- **Brief-first** vs. task-first approach
- **AI-powered breakdown** vs. manual task creation
- **Confidence delivery** vs. feature-based value

### vs. ChatGPT + MCPs + Agents
SingleBrief is **not** a general-purpose AI assistant. It's a **purpose-built confidence platform** for managers that:

1. **Persistent State Management**: Briefs, tasks, and progress live in a structured database, not ephemeral chat conversations
2. **Team Collaboration**: Human team members receive tasks, submit outputs, and collaborate within the system
3. **Manager Review Loop**: Built-in accept/reject/re-run workflow with feedback - not just prompting an AI
4. **Progress Visibility**: Real-time tracking at brief and project levels - not buried in chat history
5. **Accountability & Audit Trail**: All task outputs, decisions, and changes are tracked and auditable
6. **Business Value Framing**: "Why This Matters" is contextualized to the specific brief and organization
7. **Professional Deliverables**: PDF exports, structured outputs, searchable brief history
8. **Integrated Workflow**: One platform for planning, execution, and tracking - not tool-switching between chat and project management

**In short:** ChatGPT helps you *think* about your project. SingleBrief helps you *execute* it with your team.
