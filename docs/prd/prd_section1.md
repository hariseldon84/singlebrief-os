# SingleBrief Brownfield Enhancement PRD - Section 1

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source

**Analysis Method:** IDE-based analysis with comprehensive brainstorming documentation available

**Available Resources:**
- ✅ `docs/brainstorming-session-results.md` - Complete session analysis
- ✅ `docs/tech1.md` - First Principles Thinking
- ✅ `docs/tech2.md` - MoSCoW Prioritization
- ✅ `docs/tech3.md` - 4-week MVP constraints
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Architecture documentation
- ✅ Existing codebase (React + TypeScript + Supabase)

### Current Project State

SingleBrief is an early-stage brownfield project (initial code already started) built as a Brief-first Project OS. The current codebase is a React + TypeScript + Supabase application using the Vite build tool and shadcn/ui component library. The project is in the foundation phase with basic authentication, database schema, and UI scaffolding in place.

The project aims to solve **planning inertia and paralysis** that managers face when starting new projects - specifically the overwhelming scope of translating vision into concrete steps, time scarcity for detailed planning, and fear of missing important tasks.

### Available Documentation

**Existing Documentation:**
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Brainstorming Analysis (docs/brainstorming-session-results.md)
- ✅ First Principles Analysis (docs/tech1.md)
- ✅ MoSCoW Prioritization (docs/tech2.md)
- ✅ Resource Constraints Analysis (docs/tech3.md)

**Missing Documentation (to be created):**
- ⬜ API Documentation
- ⬜ UX/UI Guidelines
- ⬜ Technical Debt Documentation (minimal at this early stage)

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type

**Primary Enhancement Types:**
- ☑ **New Feature Addition** (Core MVP features)
- ☑ **Integration with New Systems** (AI API integration for task breakdown)
- ⬜ Major Feature Modification
- ⬜ Performance/Scalability Improvements
- ⬜ UI/UX Overhaul
- ⬜ Technology Stack Upgrade
- ⬜ Bug Fix and Stability Improvements

#### Enhancement Description

Building the complete SingleBrief MVP that transforms manager briefs into actionable micro-tasks through AI-powered breakdown, enables assignment to pre-built AI agents (Content Writer, Email Drafter) or human team members, implements a manager review loop (accept/reject/re-run), and provides visibility through progress tracking and dashboard views.

#### Impact Assessment

☑ **Major Impact (architectural changes required)**

**Rationale:**
This is a comprehensive MVP build on top of existing scaffolding. While the foundation (auth, database, basic UI) exists, the core business logic, AI integration, task management system, and manager review workflows are net-new additions that constitute the primary application functionality.

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

1. Enable managers to create briefs as simple text input without detailed task planning
2. Provide AI-powered task breakdown that eliminates planning paralysis
3. Deliver **confidence to act** through visibility into progress and task status
4. Support delegation to both AI agents and human team members with one assignee per task
5. Implement manager review loop to build trust in AI outputs (accept/reject/re-run)
6. Track progress at brief and project levels with manual refresh
7. Enable search-based brief organization
8. Generate professional deliverables via PDF export
9. Launch invite-only MVP in 4 weeks with manual invoicing

#### Background Context

Managers struggle with starting new projects because the gap between vision and execution feels overwhelming. They lack time for detailed planning, fear missing critical tasks, and sometimes lack expertise in certain domains. Traditional project management tools force managers to create 100 tasks upfront, which creates decision paralysis.

SingleBrief flips this model: managers create **one brief**, and the system handles the breakdown. The core insight from first principles analysis is that the product being sold is not task management - it's **confidence**. Confidence comes primarily through visibility into progress, followed by tracking/roll-up, AI-powered breakdown, and delegation capabilities.

This enhancement represents the complete MVP build on top of existing authentication and database scaffolding, delivering the core "confidence loop" validated through resource constraints analysis to be achievable in 4 weeks with Supabase backend.
