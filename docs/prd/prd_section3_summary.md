# PRD Section 3 - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Section:** UI Enhancement Goals & Requirements
**Elicitation Methods Used:** 9 methods (Socratic Questioning, Perspective Shifting x2, Challenge Assumptions, Scenario Planning, Trade-off Analysis, Risk Exploration, Analogical Thinking, Gap Analysis)

---

## Executive Summary

Section 3 elicitation uncovered **111 total functional requirements** (FR1-FR111) through systematic analysis of UI/UX needs. This represents a significant expansion from the original 50 FRs in prd_section2.md.

**Key Discoveries:**

1. **Team Member Perspective** - Entire team member UI was missing from original design (8 new FRs)
2. **AI Agent Execution Model** - Queuing mechanism needed instead of auto-execution (6 new FRs)
3. **Communication Features** - Task comments, @mentions essential for async collaboration (3 new FRs)
4. **Onboarding & Templates** - Blank page paralysis mitigation required (3 new FRs)
5. **Risk Mitigation** - 14 high-priority risks identified with specific UI solutions

**Status Transitions:**
```
To-Do â†’ In-Progress (human starts, sets due date)
To-Do â†’ Queued (assigned to AI agent)
Queued â†’ In-Progress (manager clicks "Run AI Tasks")
In-Progress â†’ Done (output submitted)
Done â†’ Accepted (manager accepts)
Done â†’ Rejected (manager rejects with feedback)
Rejected â†’ In-Progress (rework)
Any â†’ Archived (manager archives)
```

## Major Design Decisions Summary

### Trade-off Analysis Decisions

| Decision | Option Chosen | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Task List Layout** | Linear List with Badges | Mobile-first, 7-status support, faster implementation |
| **"Why This Matters" Display** | Collapsible (Default Collapsed) | Opt-in usage, non-intrusive, user control |
| **Task Assignment UI** | Dropdown Selector | Simple, sufficient for small teams, fast implementation |
| **AI Execution Trigger** | Manual Batch with Cost Preview | Cost control, rate limit safety, manager control |
| **Dashboard Layout** | Unified Dual-Role | Single source of truth, dual-role support |

---

### Risk Mitigation Decisions

**14 Risks Identified, 9 High Priority:**

| Risk | Mitigation | Implementation |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| "Why This Matters" ignored | Track analytics, iterate prompts | A/B testing, user interviews |
| Progress % not updated | **Optional per brief** (Decision 1-C) | Quick-update buttons, gentle nudges |
| Confirmation screen overwhelms | **Progressive disclosure** (Decision 3-B) | Show 5 tasks at a time |
| AI timeout frustrations | Dynamic estimates, 90s timeout | "Generating... typically 30-45s" |
| Queued tasks forgotten | **Aggressive reminders** (Decision 2-C) | FAB + email after 24h + daily digest |
| Team members can't find tasks | Smart sorting, visual hierarchy | Overdue first â†’ Due soon â†’ Priority |
| Rejection demotivates | Tone checker, positive reinforcement | Feedback templates, celebration animations |
| Offensive AI content | Moderation API, reporting | Content moderation before display |
| Concurrent edit conflicts | **Full presence system** (Decision 8-A) | Real-time "who's viewing" avatars |
| Accidental deletions | Soft delete, 30-day recovery | Confirmation modal, "Restore" option |

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Supabase RLS Policies Needed

**Files Access (FR74):**
- Uploaded files accessible only to: Assignee, Manager, Full Access members
- Row-level security on `task_files` table

**Task Access:**
- Team members see only tasks assigned to them OR briefs they have access to
- Managers see all tasks in their created briefs

**Notification Access:**
- Users see only their own notifications
- RLS on `notifications` table

---

### AI Integration Requirements

**LLM API Calls:**

1. **Brief Task Breakdown** (FR6)
   - Input: Brief text, max tasks setting (FR68)
   - Output: Array of tasks with title, description, priority (FR80)

2. **"Why This Matters" Generation** (FR8)
   - Input: Brief text, task list
   - Output: Business value + impact metrics

3. **AI Task Execution** (FR62-FR67)
   - Input: Task title, description, full brief context, previous outputs (FR64)
   - Output: Task completion text
   - Error handling: Timeout (90s), rate limiting, moderation

4. **AI Regeneration** (FR70, FR77)
   - Input: Previous output + manager feedback
   - Output: Improved task list or "Why This Matters"
   - Cost preview before execution

---

### Performance Considerations

**Polling Strategy (NFR29, NFR31):**
- 30-second interval for dashboard/brief updates
- Pause polling when tab inactive (Page Visibility API)
- Redis cache for frequently accessed data
- Database indexes on `status`, `updated_at`

**File Upload (FR73):**
- 10MB limit per file, up to 5 files per task
- Client-side validation before upload
- Chunked upload for files >5MB
- Compression suggestion for images

---

## Success Metrics from Elicitation

### Adoption Metrics

- **"Why This Matters" Usage:** 80% adoption rate (FR8, NFR19)
- **Task Comments Usage:** Track comment frequency (FR93)
- **Template Usage:** % of briefs created from templates vs. blank (FR95)
- **AI Queue Execution:** Median dwell time <48h (Risk 4.2)

### Quality Metrics

- **Rejection Rate:** <30% of submissions rejected (Risk 3.2)
- **AI Timeout Rate:** <15% of generations exceed 60s (Risk 2.1)
- **Progress Update Frequency:** If <30% usage, remove slider (Risk 1.2)
- **Search Abandonment:** <50% abandonment rate (Risk 3.3)

### Performance Metrics

- **Dashboard Load Time:** <3 seconds (Risk 2.2)
- **Polling Response Time:** <500ms average (NFR29)
- **File Upload Success Rate:** >90% (Risk 2.3)

## Open Questions for Section 4 (Technical Constraints)

### Infrastructure Questions

1. **Redis Cache:** Do we need Redis for polling optimization, or can we optimize with database indexes only?
2. **Background Jobs:** Queued AI tasks (FR75) - Use Supabase Edge Functions or separate job queue (Bull, BullMQ)?
3. **File Storage Limits:** Supabase Storage free tier limits - What's our storage budget for 100 users?

### AI/LLM Questions

4. **Model Selection:** OpenAI GPT-4 vs. Anthropic Claude for task breakdown - Which is more cost-effective?
5. **Token Budget:** Average tokens per brief generation - Can we estimate monthly costs?
6. **Rate Limiting:** OpenAI tier limits - Do we need to implement our own rate limiting beyond FR76's 5-second delay?

### Authentication Questions

7. **Team Invitations:** Email-based invitations - Use Supabase Auth magic links or custom invite flow?
8. **Session Management:** How long should sessions last? Refresh token strategy?
