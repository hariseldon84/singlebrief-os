## Technique Sessions

### Technique 1: First Principles Thinking - 20 min

**Description:** Strip away assumptions to identify fundamental truths about SingleBrief's problem and solution.

#### Ideas Generated:

1. **Core Problem: Planning Inertia & Paralysis**
   - Overwhelming scope (vision → concrete steps)
   - Time scarcity for detailed planning
   - Fear of missing important tasks
   - Knowledge gaps in certain domains

2. **Root Solution: Confidence**
   - Not task management - confidence to act
   - Eliminate planning paralysis through intelligent automation

3. **Confidence Delivery Mechanisms (Priority Order):**
   - Visibility into progress (PRIMARY)
   - Tracking & roll-up
   - AI-powered breakdown
   - Delegation capabilities
   - Design language (strength, action, progress)
   - Action enforcement (notifications, accountability)

4. **Minimum Viable Loop (6 Steps):**
   - Manager creates brief (text)
   - AI breaks into micro-tasks
   - Assign to AI agents or humans
   - Execute + Review cycle (accept/reject/re-run)
   - Progress tracked (brief + project level)
   - Manager dashboard (all briefs + outputs)

5. **MVP Scope Boundaries:**
   - IN: Simple team, pre-built AI agents, basic tracking
   - OUT: Advanced analytics, integrations, custom agents, hierarchy, departments

#### Insights Discovered:

- **Confidence is the actual product** - We're not selling task management, we're selling confidence to act
- **The review cycle is critical** - Manager feedback loop ensures quality and trust in AI
- **Visibility beats automation** - Seeing progress matters more than speed of execution
- **Simplicity enables speed** - Flat structures and pre-built agents remove decision paralysis

#### Notable Connections:

- Planning paralysis → Confidence deficit → Visibility as cure
- AI automation + Manager control = Trust equation
- Brief-first approach flips traditional project management (tasks → brief vs. brief → tasks)

### Technique 2: MoSCoW Prioritization - 20 min

**Description:** Categorize features into Must/Should/Could/Won't buckets for clear MVP definition.

#### Ideas Generated:

**57 Features Analyzed Across 10 Domains:**

1. Core Brief Management (5 features)
2. AI Task Breakdown (6 features)
3. Task Assignment & Execution (6 features)
4. Manager Review & Feedback (6 features)
5. Progress Tracking & Visibility (7 features)
6. Team Management (5 features)
7. Pre-built AI Agents (6 features)
8. Output & Deliverables (5 features)
9. Authentication & Account (6 features)
10. Projects & Organization (5 features)

**Prioritization Results:**
- ✅ MUST Have: 35 features (61%)
- 🟡 SHOULD Have: 5 features (9%)
- 💡 COULD Have: 4 features (7%)
- ❌ WON'T Have: 13 features (23%)

#### Insights Discovered:

- **Billing is MUST for MVP** - Monetization from day one, not freemium
- **4 AI agents selected** - Content, Email, Calendar, Research (text-focused only)
- **Full CRUD on tasks** - Manager control critical for trust
- **No auto-execution for AI** - Manual trigger simplifies complexity
- **Real-time updates deemed critical** - Confidence through live visibility

#### Notable Connections:

- Multi-assignee tasks → Collaboration is native, not bolted on
- PDF export + Summary doc → Professional deliverables matter
- Workspace management → Multi-tenant from start
- Version history as "Could" → Simplicity over sophistication

---

### Technique 3: Resource Constraints Challenge - 15 min

**Description:** "What if you had to launch in 4 weeks with Supabase only?" - Forces ruthless prioritization.

#### Ideas Generated:

**8 Major Cuts/Simplifications:**

1. **AI Agents: 4 → 2**
   - Cut: Calendar, Research
   - Keep: Content, Email
   - Rationale: Proves AI value with less complexity

2. **Summary Document → PDF Export**
   - Cut: Auto-generated summary document
   - Keep: PDF export of brief view
   - Rationale: Same deliverable, 80% less work

3. **Real-Time Updates → Manual Refresh**
   - Cut: Websockets/subscriptions
   - Keep: Refresh button
   - Rationale: Acceptable for invite-only users

4. **Automated Billing → Manual Invoicing**
   - Cut: Stripe integration
   - Keep: Invite-only + manual invoicing
   - Rationale: Controlled launch, better feedback

5. **Search + Filter → Search Only**
   - Cut: Status filtering
   - Keep: Keyword search
   - Rationale: Search covers 80% of filter use cases

6. **Multi-Assignee → Single Assignee**
   - Cut: Multiple assignees per task
   - Keep: One assignee, duplicate workaround
   - Rationale: Simpler data model

7. **Multi-Workspace → Personal Workspace**
   - Cut: Workspace switching
   - Keep: One workspace per user
   - Rationale: Reduces complexity dramatically

8. **Tags/Labels → Search Only**
   - Cut: Tag management
   - Keep: Search for organization
   - Rationale: Sufficient for low brief volumes

#### Insights Discovered:

- **Time saved: 24-37 days** - Cuts make 4-week timeline realistic
- **Simplicity accelerates launch** - 60% complexity reduction, core value intact
- **Manual processes valid for MVP** - Invite-only justifies simplification
- **AI breadth vs. depth** - 2 polished agents > 4 half-baked
- **Core loop is resilient** - Confidence value survives aggressive cuts

#### Notable Connections:

- Invite-only becomes a feature (not limitation) → Justifies manual invoicing
- Manual refresh acceptable → Users tolerate clicking for early access
- Personal workspace → Simpler mental model aligns with invite-only

- **AI breadth vs depth trade-off**: 2 excellent AI agents beat 4 mediocre ones - focus matters
- **The review loop is non-negotiable**: Accept/reject/re-run is what transforms AI from scary to trustworthy
- **Simplicity has compounding returns**: Every cut makes every other feature easier to build and use
- **Timeline constraints force clarity**: 4-week deadline eliminated feature bloat and revealed true priorities
- **Brownfield advantage**: Existing code reduces risk and provides implementation reference

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well

- **First Principles approach** - Identified "confidence" as core product, not features
- **Ruthless prioritization** - MoSCoW + constraints eliminated feature bloat
- **4-week forcing function** - Timeline constraint drove clarity
- **Brownfield context** - Existing codebase reduces implementation risk
- **Focus on value over sophistication** - Manual processes acceptable for MVP
- **AI-first but human-controlled** - Review loop balances automation with trust

### Areas for Further Exploration

- **Pricing model**: Per-user subscription vs per-brief usage vs flat team rate?
- **AI agent quality thresholds**: What acceptance rate validates an agent for launch?
- **Notification strategy**: How aggressive should task assignment notifications be?
- **Task status taxonomy**: To Do / In Progress / Under Review / Complete sufficient?
- **Brief template structure**: Free-text only or guided input fields?
- **Team size limits**: What's realistic team size for personal workspace model?
- **Export formats**: PDF sufficient or also DOCX, Markdown, etc.?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- **User Story Mapping**: Map out detailed user journeys for each role (manager, team member, AI agent)
- **Assumption Testing**: Validate core assumptions (managers want AI breakdown, review loop feels natural)
- **Competitive Analysis**: Study existing tools (Asana, Monday, ClickUp) to identify differentiation opportunities
- **Technical Spike**: Prototype AI breakdown to validate feasibility and quality
- **Pricing Research**: Interview target customers on willingness-to-pay

### Questions That Emerged

- How do we measure "confidence" as a product metric?
- What's the minimum brief length for useful AI breakdown?
- Should AI agents be visible team members or invisible automation?
- How do we handle briefs that span multiple departments (post-MVP)?
- What's the upgrade path from personal workspace to multi-org?
- How do we prevent AI agent hallucination in task breakdown?
- Should task outputs be editable by manager or immutable?
- What happens when an AI agent fails to complete a task?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:**
  - User Story Mapping workshop
  - Technical architecture review (Supabase schema design)
  - Go-to-market strategy (who are first 20 beta customers?)
  - AI prompt engineering session (optimize breakdown quality)

- **Recommended timeframe:**
  - Within 1 week (maintain momentum)

- **Preparation needed:**
  - Review MoSCoW categories
  - Sketch database schema draft
  - Identify 3-5 target beta customers
  - Research AI prompt best practices
