# Brainstorming Session - Technique 1: First Principles Thinking

**Session Date:** 2025-10-04
**Product:** SingleBrief - Brief-first Project OS
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary üìä
**Focus:** MVP Feature Scoping

---

## Session Context

**Product Overview:**
SingleBrief is a Brief-first Project OS. Instead of creating 100 tasks, managers/leaders create a single Brief, which the system breaks down into micro-tasks. Tasks can be assigned to AI agents (auto-execution) or real employees (manual execution). The platform tracks all micro-tasks and rolls progress back into the original Brief.

**Constraints:**
- Timeline: MVP launch timeline constraints
- Technical: No-code backend (Supabase or similar)
- Scope: MVP features only (not full product vision)

## Fundamental Problem Identified

### What is the core problem SingleBrief solves?

**Planning Inertia & Paralysis** - Managers/leaders struggle with:
1. Getting started on new projects/briefs
2. Detailing out required tasks
3. Creating even a first-level action plan

### Root Causes of Inertia

1. **Overwhelming Scope**
   - Translating vision ‚Üí concrete steps feels massive
   - The gap between idea and execution is daunting

2. **Time Scarcity**
   - Planning takes too long
   - Managers don't have time for detailed task breakdown

3. **Fear of Incompleteness**
   - "What am I missing?"
   - Anxiety about overlooking important tasks

4. **Knowledge Gaps**
   - Lack of expertise in certain areas of the scope
   - Uncertainty about best practices in unfamiliar domains

---

## Core Solution Mechanism

### The Primary Driver: **CONFIDENCE**

SingleBrief's fundamental job is to provide **confidence** that:
- Nothing important is missed
- The plan is comprehensive
- Managers can move forward immediately without fear

### Confidence Delivery Mechanisms (Priority Order)

1. **Visibility into Progress** (PRIMARY)
   - Real-time view of what's happening
   - Transparency across all tasks

2. **Tracking & Roll-up**
   - Progress aggregated at brief and project levels
   - Clear status indicators

3. **AI-Powered Breakdown**
   - Intelligent task decomposition
   - Domain-aware best practices

4. **Delegation Capabilities**
   - Assign to AI agents or humans
   - Freedom from micromanagement

5. **Design Language**
   - Visual appeal conveying strength, action, progress
   - Interface inspires confidence through design

6. **Action Enforcement**
   - Notifications ensure tasks get done
   - Reports and accountability mechanisms
   - Not just planning - ensuring execution

## Minimum Viable Loop (MVP Core Flow)

### The 6-Step Confidence Loop

**1. Brief Creation**
- Manager inputs brief (text input)
- Simple, low-friction entry point

**2. AI Breakdown**
- System decomposes brief into micro-tasks
- (Future: Department assignment - NOT in MVP)

**3. Task Assignment**
- **AI Agents:** Pre-configured agents handle specific task types
  - Content generation
  - Email drafts
  - Calendar invite summaries
  - Other pre-built automation
- **Human Team Members:** Tasks assigned to people on the team

**4. Execution + Review Cycle**
- AI or human completes the task
- Result shared with manager including:
  - Status update
  - Task output/result
- Manager actions:
  - **Re-run** the task
  - **Give feedback** for revision
  - **Accept** as complete

**5. Progress Tracking**
- Brief-level tracking
- Project-level aggregation
- Real-time status updates

**6. Manager Dashboard**
- Overview of all briefs
- Completion status per brief
- Final outputs (e.g., summary documents, deliverables)

## MVP Scope Boundaries

### ‚úÖ IN Scope for MVP

- Simple flat team structure
- Pre-configured AI agents only (no custom configuration)
- Basic progress tracking
- Core confidence loop (steps 1-6 above)

### ‚ùå Explicitly OUT of MVP

- **Advanced Analytics/Reporting**
  - Keep metrics simple and focused
  - Deep insights can come in v2

- **Integrations with External Tools**
  - No Slack, Jira, Asana, etc. integrations
  - Standalone product first

- **Custom AI Agent Configuration**
  - Users cannot create or customize agents
  - Pre-built agents only

- **Team Hierarchy Management**
  - No org charts, reporting structures, departments
  - Simple team member list

- **Department Assignment**
  - Tasks don't get categorized by department
  - Can be added post-MVP

## Key Insights from First Principles Analysis

1. **Confidence is the Product**
   - We're not selling task management
   - We're selling the confidence to act

2. **The Review Cycle is Critical**
   - Manager feedback loop ensures quality
   - AI outputs aren't blindly accepted

3. **Visibility Beats Automation**
   - Seeing progress matters more than speed
   - Transparency builds trust

4. **Simplicity Enables Speed**
   - Flat team structure removes complexity
   - Pre-built agents prevent decision paralysis

---

## Questions for Next Phase

- What specific AI agents should be pre-built for MVP?
- What does "progress tracking" look like visually?
- How does the manager-AI feedback loop work (UI/UX)?
- What's the minimum set of task statuses needed?
