## User Journey

**Happy Path:**
1. Manager clicks "Create Brief" button
2. Dialog opens with title and description fields
3. Manager enters title: "Q1 2025 Marketing Campaign"
4. Manager enters description (500 words)
5. Character count shows "500/5000"
6. Manager clicks "Generate Tasks"
7. Loading indicator: "Generating tasks..."
8. AI generates 15 tasks in 30 seconds
9. Progressive disclosure: Shows 5 tasks at a time
10. Manager unchecks 2 tasks, clicks "Show More"
11. Reviews next 5 tasks, all look good
12. Clicks "Confirm Tasks"
13. Brief status â†’ 'active', 13 tasks finalized
14. Dashboard now shows 1 active brief

## Success Criteria

**Product Metrics:**
- âœ… 90%+ of briefs successfully generate tasks on first try
- âœ… AI task generation completes in <60 seconds (95th percentile)
- âœ… <10% task regeneration rate (indicates good initial quality)
- âœ… 80%+ of users confirm â‰¥70% of AI-generated tasks

**Technical Metrics:**
- âœ… n8n workflow success rate >95%
- âœ… OpenRouter API response time <10 seconds
- âœ… Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- âœ… Database constraints enforced (title â‰¤200 chars, description â‰¤5000 chars)

**UX Metrics:**
- âœ… Brief creation flow completion rate >85%
- âœ… Average time to create first brief <5 minutes
- âœ… Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load (user feedback)

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies:
- **n8n instance** running with webhook endpoints
- **OpenRouter API** account with GPT-4o-mini access
- **Supabase** database with briefs and tasks tables

### Internal Dependencies:
- **Supabase Auth** for user authentication (Epic 8)
- **Database schema** migration complete (see SETUP_GUIDE.md)

### Epic Dependencies:
- **None** - This is the foundation epic

---

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components:
1. **BriefCreationDialog** - shadcn/ui Dialog with form
2. **TaskConfirmationList** - Progressive disclosure UI
3. **TaskCard** - Individual task preview with checkbox
4. **BriefTemplateSelector** - Dropdown for templates

### n8n Workflows:
1. **Brief Task Breakdown** (`POST /webhook/generate-tasks`)
   - Input: `{ brief_id, user_id, jwt_token }`
   - Process: Fetch brief â†’ Call OpenRouter â†’ Parse response â†’ Insert tasks
   - Output: `{ task_count, tasks[] }`

2. **AI Cost Estimation** (optional)
   - Calculate tokens and cost before generation

### Database Tables:
- `briefs` (extended with title, description, task_count)
- `tasks` (basic task structure)
- `user_settings` (default_task_limit)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1.1: AI Task Quality (High)
**Risk:** AI-generated tasks may be low quality, vague, or irrelevant

**Mitigation:**
- Story 1.3: Progressive confirmation allows manual review
- Story 1.4: Inline editing for quick fixes
- Story 1.5: Max 3 regeneration attempts to refine
- Prompt engineering: Provide clear AI instructions
- Fallback: Manual task creation always available

### Risk 1.2: OpenRouter API Latency (Medium)
**Risk:** Slow AI responses (>60 seconds) cause poor UX

**Mitigation:**
- Use GPT-4o-mini (fastest model)
- Show loading indicator with progress
- Timeout after 90 seconds with retry option
- Cache brief context to avoid re-sending

### Risk 1.3: Complex Briefs Exceed Token Limit (Low)
**Risk:** Very long descriptions (5000 chars) may exceed API limits

**Mitigation:**
- Truncate description to 3000 chars for AI call
- Warn user at 3000 char count
- Full description still saved in database

### Risk 1.4: User Overwhelm (Medium)
**Risk:** 20 tasks at once may overwhelm managers

**Mitigation:**
- Story 1.3: Progressive disclosure (5 at a time)
- Story 1.8: Configurable task limit (default 20, range 5-50)
- Visual design: Clean, minimal UI

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- Form validation (title length, description length, required fields)
- Character count accuracy
- Task checkbox state management
- Progressive disclosure logic (show 5, then 10, then 15, etc.)

### Integration Tests:
- n8n workflow end-to-end (webhook â†’ AI â†’ database)
- Brief creation â†’ task generation â†’ confirmation flow
- Draft saving and resuming
- Template application

### E2E Tests (Playwright):
- Complete brief creation happy path
- Task regeneration with different limits
- Template selection and usage
- Error handling (API timeout, invalid input)
